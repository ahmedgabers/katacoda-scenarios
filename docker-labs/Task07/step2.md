3- Create a Dockerfile for the backend 

4- Give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 8000 exposed and published so when you start the container and   navigate to http://localhost:8000 you will generate a message in logs.txt in the working directory.

5- Create a volume for the logs.txt so that when the application is shut down the logs are not destroyed. And when restarted it continues to write into the same logs.txt.

Save the Dockerfile as Dockerfile.backend in Day01/ directory
