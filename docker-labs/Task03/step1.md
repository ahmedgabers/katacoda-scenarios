Start image devopsdockeruh/exec_bash_exercise, it will start a container with clock-like features and create a log. Go inside the container and use `tail -f ./logs.txt` to follow the logs. Every 15 seconds the clock will send you a “secret message”.

Save the secret message in a text file and store in Day01/ directory
