Take your time to read the description.


# Instructions:

1- Create a Dockerfile for the frontend

2- Give a command so that the project runs in a docker container with port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to http://localhost:5000 you will see message if you’re successful.


`Note: The app starts to accept connections when “Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000” has been printed to the screen, this takes a minute or so, check the logs when the container is running`
